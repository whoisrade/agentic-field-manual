Template for presenting AI system risk and strategy to boards, executives, and investors.

## Opening Statement

AI products have a unique failure mode: they can work perfectly and still become impossible to explain.

When that happens, we cannot defend our decisions to customers, regulators, or partners. This presentation covers where we are, what risks we face, and what we are doing about it.

## The Four Risks

### 1. Legibility Risk

**What it means:** We cannot explain why the system did what it did.

**Business impact:**
- Customer support cannot resolve complaints
- Engineering cannot debug issues efficiently
- Legal cannot respond to inquiries

**Our status:** [ ] Low [ ] Medium [ ] High

**Evidence:**

### 2. Control Surface Risk

**What it means:** User behavior is driving up costs invisibly.

**Business impact:**
- Margin erodes without clear cause
- Cost forecasting becomes unreliable
- Hidden subsidies to specific user behaviors

**Our status:** [ ] Low [ ] Medium [ ] High

**Evidence:**

### 3. Auditability Risk

**What it means:** We can show what the system output but not why.

**Business impact:**
- Enterprise deals blocked by security reviews
- Regulatory exposure in regulated industries
- Inability to prove compliance

**Our status:** [ ] Low [ ] Medium [ ] High

**Evidence:**

### 4. Margin Fragility

**What it means:** Growth is making us less profitable.

**Business impact:**
- Unit economics degrade at scale
- Success accelerates cost problems
- Fundraising or profitability targets at risk

**Our status:** [ ] Low [ ] Medium [ ] High

**Evidence:**
