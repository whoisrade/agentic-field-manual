## Key Messages for Leadership

### The Risk

AI products have a unique failure mode: they can work perfectly and still become impossible to explain. When that happens, you cannot defend decisions to customers, regulators, or partners.

### The Four Risks (Plain Language)

| Technical Term | Executive Translation |
|----------------|----------------------|
| Legibility Loss | We cannot explain why the system did what it did |
| Control Surface Drift | User behavior is driving up costs invisibly |
| Auditability Gap | We can show what happened but not why |
| Margin Fragility | Growth is making us less profitable |

### The Ask

Customize for your situation:
- Budget for infrastructure investment
- Headcount for observability/compliance
- Timeline for architectural changes
- Approval for vendor changes
