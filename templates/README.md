# Templates

Use these Monday.

These templates are designed to be immediately actionable. Print them, fill them in, run the meeting.

## What's Here

| Template | When to Use It |
|----------|---------------|
| [Decision Log](decision-log.md) | Before any architectural decision that will be hard to reverse |
| [System Drift Review](system-drift-review.md) | Quarterly, or after any major incident |
| [Traceability Checklist](traceability-checklist.md) | Before shipping any major AI system change |
| [First 48 Hours](first-48-hours.md) | When margin is collapsing and you need to act now |
| [Board Explainer](board-explainer.md) | When you need to explain AI system risk to non-technical stakeholders |

## How to Use These

1. **Don't customize first.** Run the template as-is once. See what it reveals.
2. **Fill in the blanks.** Every blank is a question you should be able to answer.
3. **If you can't answer, that's the finding.** Missing answers are signals, not failures.
4. **Assign owners and timelines.** Templates without owners become shelfware.

## The Pattern

Every template follows the same structure:
1. **Signals** - what to look for
2. **Root causes** - what's driving it
3. **Actions** - what to do
4. **Owners** - who's responsible
5. **Evidence** - how to prove it's fixed

If you can complete the template, you understand the problem. If you can't, you've found the gap.
