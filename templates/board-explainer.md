# Board Explainer

Template for explaining AI system risk to non-technical stakeholders.

Use this when you need to communicate with board members, investors, or executives who don't have technical depth but need to understand the risks and tradeoffs.

## The Setup (30 seconds)

> "AI products have a unique failure mode: they can work perfectly and still become impossible to explain. When that happens, we lose the ability to defend our decisions to customers, regulators, and partners."

---

## The Framework (2 minutes)

### The 4 Failure Modes

| Failure Mode | Plain English | Business Impact |
|-------------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Legibility Loss** | We can't explain why the system did what it did | Lost enterprise deals, regulatory exposure |
| **Control Surface Drift** | User behavior is driving up costs invisibly | Margin erosion, CFO questions |
| **Auditability Gap** | We can show what happened but not why | Compliance risk, enterprise blockers |
| **Margin Fragility** | Growth makes us less profitable | Unit economics collapse at scale |

### The 3 Decisions That Lock Us In

| Decision | What It Means | Why It Matters |
|----------|--------------|----------------|
| **State Model** | What data we store and how | Changes later require migrations |
| **Interaction Contract** | What users can do | Users form habits, can't remove features |
| **Control Plane Ownership** | What we own vs rent | Vendor lock-in, compliance control |

## Where We Are Today (customize)

| Auditability | | ☐ Low  ☐ Medium  ☐ High |
| Margin Stability | | ☐ Low  ☐ Medium  ☐ High |

## Questions to Expect

**"Why is this different from normal software?"**
> AI systems create outputs we can't fully predict. Unlike traditional software where we write the rules, AI learns patterns that we need to be able to explain and defend.

**"How much will this cost to fix?"**
> [Customize based on your situation]

**"Why didn't we build it right the first time?"**
> We optimized for speed to market, which was correct. Now we're at the stage where we need to harden the architecture for scale and enterprise customers.

**"What happens if we don't do this?"**
> Increasing margin pressure, lost enterprise deals that require audit trails, and compliance risk as regulations tighten.

## One-Liner Summary

> "We're investing in making our AI system explainable and efficient at scale. This protects our margin, unlocks enterprise sales, and keeps us ahead of regulation."
