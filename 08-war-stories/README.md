## After Reading

- Recognize the pattern before it causes damage

- Apply the fix that worked in a real system
- Point to external sources for deeper validation

The numbers are illustrative. The timelines are compressed. The details are abstracted.

What is true: **the patterns**. These failure modes happen. The fixes work.

Each story includes references to external sources so you can verify the underlying principles independently.
