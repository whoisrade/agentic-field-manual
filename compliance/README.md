# Compliance and Sovereignty

Enterprise customers and regulators are moving from "show me outputs" to "show me reasoning, data lineage, and control."

This section covers what you need to prove - and own - to win enterprise deals and survive audits.

## What's Here

| Topic | What It Covers |
|-------|---------------|
| [Auditability](auditability.md) | What evidence you need to prove system behavior |
| [Sovereignty](sovereignty.md) | How to guarantee where data lives and who controls it |
| [Operational Independence](operational-independence.md) | How to run without vendor dependency |

## The Reality in 2026

Sovereignty is no longer a "future" concern for global SaaS selling to enterprise. It's a vendor-selection requirement.

If you can't answer these questions with evidence, you will lose deals:
- Where is data stored and processed?
- Can you prove locality under audit?
- Can you isolate tenants by region and policy?
- Can you run critical functions without third-party dependency?

## The Auditability Standard

Logging is not auditability. **Reconstructability** is auditability.

You need to be able to reproduce:
- What the system knew at decision time
- What actions it took and why
- Who approved the outcome
- Which policies were in effect

If you can only show outputs without rationale, you have an auditability gap.

## When to Use This Section

- You're preparing for an enterprise security review
- You're responding to a compliance questionnaire
- You're designing for regulated industries (finance, healthcare, government)
- You need to explain data residency to a European customer
